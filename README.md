# A* Path Finding Visual Tool

This project is a Python-based visualization tool for the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm using Pygame. A* is a popular algorithm used for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph, often used in various applications such as robotics, video games, and maps.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: The tool provides an interactive environment where users can create barriers, set start and end points, and visualize the A* algorithm finding the shortest path in real-time.
- **Customizable Grid**: Users can adjust the grid size to visualize pathfinding on different scales.
- **Efficient Algorithm**: The A* algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path while considering both the cost to reach a node and the estimated cost to reach the goal node.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (installed via pip: `pip install pygame`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AStarPathVisualTool.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AStarPathVisualTool`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

1. Run the main script: `python main.py`
2. Left-click to draw barriers, right-click to erase them.
3. Press the spacebar to start the pathfinding algorithm.
4. Press 'c' to clear the grid and start over.
